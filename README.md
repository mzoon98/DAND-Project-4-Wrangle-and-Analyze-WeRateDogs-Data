# DAND-Project-4-Wrangle-and-Analyze-WeRateDogs-Data
There is an interesting Twitter account called WeRateDogs or @dog_rate which has over 8.9 million followers as of Jan 2021. The account tweets adorable pictures of dogs and puppies with a hilarious comment about them in addition to a rating to the dog on scale of 10

In this project, I learned and practiced data wrangling and analyzing as part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The wrangled and analyzed dataset that is the tweet archive of the Twitter account WeRateDogs that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I used Python Prgramming Language and documented it using a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb).
